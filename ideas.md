## The Game

The game works like rock-paper-scissors. Player *A* has an advantage against 
player *B*, player *B* against *C* and player *C* against *A*.

So initially `A > B > C > A` holds true.

The goal of the game is to overwhelm the other players without being defeated
yourself. So be aware: Attacking your inferior opponent will result in you
having a weak defense against your stronger enemy.

## Simple Graphics

 * Squares are buildings, triangles are units, dots are bullets.

 * Two units may disguise as a building
    * Maybe stronger armour, but unable to shoot?
